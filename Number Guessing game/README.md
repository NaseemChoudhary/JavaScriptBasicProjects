## 🧠 How It Works

- A random number is generated when the page loads using `Math.random()`.
- The player enters a number between **1 and 100**.
- On each submit:
  - If the guess is correct → player wins.
  - If the guess is within ±10 → shows "Close".
  - Otherwise → shows "Too far".
- After maximum attempts, the game ends and input is disabled.
